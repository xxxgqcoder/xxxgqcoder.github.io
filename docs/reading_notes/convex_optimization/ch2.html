        <h2>2.5 Separating and supporting hyperplanes</h2>
        <h3>2.5.1 Separating hyperplane theorem</h3>
        <p>
            suppose C and D is non-empty and disjoint convex set, then there mus
            exists \( a \ne 0 \) and \( b \) such that \( a^T x + b \le 0 \) for
            all \( x \in C \)
        </p>
        <p>
            assume the distance between C and D is defined as
            \[
                \operatorname{dist}(C, D) = \operatorname{inf}\{ ||u-v||_2 \ \big| u \in C, \ v \in D \}
            \]
            is positive. (inf means Infimum).
            
            and there exists points \( c \in C \) and \( d \in D \) achieve the minimum distance, e.g.
            \( ||c-d||_2 = \operatorname{dist}(C, D) \).
            it is satisfied if C and D is closed and one set is bounded.
        </p>
        <p>
            define
            \[
                a = d-c, \ b = { ||d||_2^2 - ||c||^2_2 \over 2}
            \]
            we will find that affine function
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                    f(x) & = a^Tx -b \\
                    & = (d-c)^T x - { ||d||_2^2 - ||c||^2_2 \over 2} \\
                    & = (d-c)^T x - { (d-c)^T(d+c) \over 2} \\
                    & = (d-c)^T( x - {(d+c) \over 2} )
                \end{aligned}
            \]
            separate \( C \) and \( D \).
        </p>
        <p>
            to prove \( f \) is nonnegative on \( D \).

            suppose there is a point \( u \) in \( D \) such that
            \[
                f(u) = (d-c)^T( u - {(d+c) \over 2} ) \lt 0
            \]

            rewrite \( f(u) \) as
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                f(u) & = (d-c)^T( u - d + (d-c)/2) \\
                    & = (d-c)^T(u-d) + ||d-c||^2_2/2 \\
                \end{aligned}
            \]

            if \( f(u) \lt 0 \) holds, then we will have \( (d-c)^T(u-d) \lt 0 \),

            now observe that
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                    & \frac{d}{dt} || d + t(u-d) - c||^2_2 \\

                    = & \frac{d}{dt} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ t^2(u_i - d_i)^2 + 2t(u_i-d_i)(d_i-c_i) + (d_i-c_i)^2 \right] \\

                    = & \frac{d}{dt} \left[ t^2 ||u-d||^2_2 + 2t (d-c)^T(u-d) + ||d-c||^2_2 \right] \\

                    = & 2t ||u-d||^2_2 + 2(d-c)^T(u-d) \\

                    & \ \\

                    & \frac{d}{dt} || d + t(u-d) - c||^2_2 \Big|_{t=0} = 2(d-c)^T(u-d) \lt 0

                \end{aligned}
            \]

            so for small \( t \in (0, 1] \) we will have
            \[
                ||d + t(u-d) - c||_2 \lt ||d-c||_2
            \]

            which means point \( d + t(u-d) \) is closer to c that d is.
            and since \( D \) is convex and \( d + t(u-d) = (1-t)d + tu \in D \). this
            leads to conflict since \( d \) is assumed to be the point in \( D \) that
            is closet to \( c \)

            NOTE: \( t \in (0, 1] \) is just to prove convex combination of \( u \)
            and \( d \) is in \( D \), actually \( t \) can take a narrow range such
            as \( (0, \epsilon) \) where \( \epsilon \) is a small value but less than 1
